# User Specifics

## Tool Uses

- For code-related tasks, ALWAYS use `serena` MCP tools. You need to call `activate_project` first, the project name usually is the current directory full path. If the project doesn't exist, still call `activate_project` to create it.
- The `WebSearch` tool is deprecated, use `firecrawl` MCP's tool `firecrawl_search` instead.
- The `WebFetch` tool is deprecated, use `firecrawl` MCP's tool `firecrawl_scrape` instead.
